# LLM_based-health-q-a-model
Developed a dual-function intelligent health assistant capable of: ∗ Predicting diseases from user symptoms. ∗ Answering medical questions using contextual retrieval and lightweight LLMs.
#Built a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using FAISS and TinyLLaMA.
– Implemented symptom-to-disease prediction using classical machine learning models.
– Designed an intuitive web interface using Gradio for seamless user interaction.
– Tools Used: TinyLLaMA, FAISS, LangChain, Sentence Transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2), Scikit-learn, Gradio.
